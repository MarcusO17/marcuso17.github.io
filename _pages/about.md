hello!!! I'm Marcus, and welcome to my blogfolio. I'm a software engineer at **Keysight Technologies** and a recent graduate of the Bachelor of Computer Science program at INTI International College Penang, in collaboration with Coventry University. I'm fascinated by deep learning and all its related works and I'm currently diving deep into the subject through self-study.

this is my personal space to break down what I'm learning -- whether it's new papers, concepts or news. I like to keep things casual but substantive, blending my personal thoughts with technical substance.

I've previously interned at **Keysight Technologies** as a machine learning software engineer, and before my bachelor's, I was an ML research assistant for [Dr. Fakithah Ridzuan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fakhitahridzuan). During that time, I managed to publish my first paper, which was pretty cool.

beyond work, I enjoy music, motorsports, games, and photography. If you're interested in collaborating or just want to talk, I'm always down to learn more or share what I know.
